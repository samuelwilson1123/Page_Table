This project is a page table implementation that I implemented for my 
Operating Systems class as UGA taught by Professor Wenwen Wang. This program
offers 4 different page replacement algorithms as well as variable amounts of 
page frames and processes. Use the "make" command to build the project, and 
execute "./vm" to see exact usage guidelines. Use any inputs in the 
example_inputs folder for inputs, or generate a random input file using
"./input_gen".
